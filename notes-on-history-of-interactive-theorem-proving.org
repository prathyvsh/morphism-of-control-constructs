* History of Interactive Theorem Proving
John Harrison, Josef Urban, Freek Wiedijk (2014)


Interactive Theorem Proving
An arrangement where the machine and a human user work together interactively to produce a formal proof.

Possibilities:

Computer as a checker of a formal proof produced by a human
Prover may be highly automated and powerful

Most of the earliest work on computer-assisted proof in the 1950s

A computer program for Presburger’s algorithm
Davis 1957

A proof method for quantification theory: Its justification and realization
Gilmore 1960

A computer procedure for quantification theory
Davis and Putnam 1960

Toward Mechanical Mathematics
Wang 1960

A mechanical proof procedure and its realization in an electronic computer
Dag Prawitz, Håken Prawitz, Neri Voghera 1960

and 1960s

A machine-oriented logic based on the resolution principle
Robinson 1965

An inverse method of establishing deducibility in classical predicate calculus
Maslov 1964

Mechanical theorem-proving by model elimination
Loveland 1968

was dedicated to automated theorem proving.

AI-style approaches:

The logic theory machine
Newell and Simon 1956

Realization of a geometry-theorem proving machine
Gelerntner 1959

Some automatic proofs in analysis
Bledsoe 1984

The work of proof in the age of human-machine collaboration
Dick 2011


Proofchecker
Paul Abrahams
Machine Verification of Mathematical Proof (1963)

Paul Abrahams introduced in embryonic form many ideas that became significant later:

- a kind of macro facility for derived inference rules
- the integration of calculational derivations as well as natural deduction rules

Automatic theorem proof-checking in set theory: A preliminary report — Bledsoe and Gilbert 1967 was inspired by Bledsoe’s interest in formalizing the already unusually formal proofs in his PhD adviser A. P. Morse’s  ‘Set Theory’.
